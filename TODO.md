# TODO

- [ ] Relatedly, it would be really helpful for debugging if you did the thing
  we talked about where it catches exceptions and reverts to the previous undo
  state, and just prints out the stack trace. (I think it was crashes that
  happen during termToNode that don't get caught? Crashes when it updates the
  state are already being caught)
